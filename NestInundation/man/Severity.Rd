\title{Calculate the proportion of the egg chamber affected based on reported water level (i.e., inundation severity)}
\usage{
Severity(maxClutch, minClutch, inundLevel)
}
\arguments{
\item{maxClutch}{The maximum depth of the egg chamber from the ground surface at the time of deposition in centimeters}

\item{minClutch}{The minimum depth of the egg chamber from the ground surface at the time of deposition in centimeters}

\item{inundLevel}{The depth of the water above the sensor in cm}
}
\value{
Proportion of egg chamber affected by inundation assuming the nest chamber is a sphere with radius (maxClutch - minClutch)/2
}
