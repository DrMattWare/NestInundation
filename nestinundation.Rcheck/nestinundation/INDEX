                        chamber
Pass_QC02               Data record is long enough or user permits
                        continued processing
Plot_Inspection         Inspect depth and temperature time-series
Process_MovingWindow    Umbrella function to transform depth data,
                        determine severity, and output results to a new
                        dataset when a moving window is selected
Process_Normal          Umbrella function to transform depth data,
                        determine severity, and output results to a new
                        dataset when no moving window is selected
QCCheck_Window          QC Check: Ask whether to apply moving window
                        smoother to high-frequency data
Severity                Calculate the proportion of the egg chamber
                        affected based on reported water level (i.e.,
                        inundation severity)
