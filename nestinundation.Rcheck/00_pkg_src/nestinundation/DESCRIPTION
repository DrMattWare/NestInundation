Description: This code was developed to automate the analysis of water level data collected from HOBO U20L-04 loggers deployed to evaluate habitat suitability and lethal exposures of groundwater inundation to incubating sea turtle clutches.
    This approach can equally be applied to other species groups using other logger technologies so long as the following information is available:
    From the logger and/or supplied by the user - 
        Date-Time Stamp for water level observations
        Time zone of the observations
        Depth observations for water level above the logger sensor in meters
        Temperature observations in degrees Celsius
    About the clutch and logger deployment strategy supplied by the user - 
        Nest ID
        Date-Time the clutch was laid
        Date-Time the logger was deployed
        Date-Time the clutch hatched (can be NA if hatching was not observed)
        Date-Time the logger was recovered
        Minimum and maximum clutch depth relative to ground surface in centimeters at the time of logger deployment
        Depth of the logger sensor relative to ground surface in centimeters at the time of deployment
        Average incubation duration of clutches in the region in days
        Background noise level in centimeters to remove spurius fluctuations around the logger sensor (related to sensor error and resolution)
