Clean_Depth_Data        Umbrella function to clean depth data and
                        identify inundation events including several QC
                        checks using user input
Demo_Data               Example data An example datafile reported from
                        a HOBO U20L-04 water level logger deployed
                        adjacent to a sea turtle nest ...
Depth_Check             Check that reported water levels are above
                        logger as opposed to depth below surface
Event_Table             Details of each inundation event
Export_Tables           Prepare tables for export to Excel
ID_Inundation           Identifies inundation events relative to nest
                        chamber
Pass_QC02               Data record is long enough or user permits
                        continued processing
Plot_Inspection         Plot water level and temperature time-series
Process_MovingWindow    Umbrella function to transform depth data,
                        determine severity, and output results to a new
                        dataset when a moving window is selected
Process_Normal          Umbrella function to transform depth data,
                        determine severity, and output results to a new
                        dataset when no moving window is selected
QCCheck_Window          QC Check: Ask whether to apply moving window
                        smoother to high-frequency data
Severity                Calculate the proportion of the egg chamber
                        affected based on reported water level (i.e.,
                        inundation severity)
Summary_Table           Summarize inundation exposure across deployment
Temperature_Table       Summarize reported temperature across
                        deployment
Transform_Data_Normal   Transform raw depth measurements above sensor
                        and calculate depth of incursion, if any, into
                        the egg chamber when no moving window is
                        selected
Transform_Data_Window   Transform raw depth measurements above sensor
                        and calculate depth of incursion, if any, into
                        the egg chamber when a moving window is
                        selected
WaterDepth_kPa          Calculate water depth above sensor based on
                        pressure in kilopascals
WaterDepth_mbar         Calculate water depth above sensor based on
                        pressure in millibars
kPa_mbar                Convert kilopascals to millibars
